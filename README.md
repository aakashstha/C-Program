# This task is based on Numerical Methods and Concurrency.
## Content
1. Task-1: Linear Regression
2. Task-2: Calculating Pi using Leibniz formula and multithreading
3. Task-3: Finding prime numbers from multiple text files using multithreading
4. Task-4: Gaussian Blur with multithreading   

## To complete this task the knowledge of Mathematics, C-Programming and Concurrency is used.
<br>

1. This project consist of 4 task which is written in C-programming language.
2. To run this task you need to have gcc c compiler install in your machine.
3. If you are running on macOS then installing X-Code makes it lot easier and you will get pre install gcc compiler.
4. After installing gcc compiler and downloading this project. Navigate to this file using Terminal or Command Prompt. After that visit which task you want to run from down below.
5. In my case I had used Visual Studio Code (VS-Code in short) and its integrated Terminal to run all my tasks which makes it lot easier for me.
<hr>

## For running this project.
1. For Task-1
    * From the CLI type = gcc task1.c -o xyz1
    * ./xyz1
2. For Task-2
    * From the CLI type = gcc task2.c -o xyz2 -pthread
    * ./xyz2
3. For Task-3
    * From the CLI type = gcc task3.c -o xyz3 -pthread
    * ./xyz3 4
4. For Task-4
    * From the CLI type = gcc lodepng.c task4.c -o xyz4 -pthread
    * ./xyz4

### Output
1. #### The console will generate the equation and to input new value of x to predict y value, and if you input 55 then the program will predict something like 173.379029 :- 
    <pre>
    The equation of a straight line is y = -0.070252x + 177.242871
    Enter the new value of x to predicit the value of y:
    55
    Your new predicted value of y is = 173.379029
    </pre>

2. #### The console will ask you to input iteration for loop and next in how many threads you want to run this loop after placing both value you can see the output like down below.
    <pre>
    How many times you want to loop through this Leibniz formula to get precise value of Pi:
    10000
    How many threads you would like to use to solve this problem:
    8

    The final value of Pi = 3.141692
    </pre>

3. #### Check NewPrimeOnly.txt file that has been generated after compiling task3.c

4. #### Check WOW_Image.png file that has been generated after compiling task4.c
#### Image input 
<img src="Data/image.png">

#### Image output after running task4.c
#### You can notice the difference that output image is little blurry than the input one.

## Extra Information and some warning/!!

### gcc lodepng.c filename -o xyz -pthread 
* gcc is a c compiler which converts c language to machine readable language.
* next in task-4 we had used lodepng.c which is a third-party library used for decoding and encoding png files also used to manipulate them.
* now filename which in our case is task1 and so on.
* next we have -o which is used to output object file in c which is also a executable file in c.
* then we have xyz is the compiled file of the task. 
* -phread is used for multithreading in c.

#### In most of the case you will not encounter any error but if you run into some warning like the down below then do not worry because it is simple warning which is saying to change the entry level main function return type from void to int. Here I don't like to change because I always keep main function return type to void for simplicity.
<br>
<pre>
    task1.c:76:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
    void main()
    ^
    task1.c:76:1: note: change return type to 'int'
    void main()
    ^~~~
    int
    1 warning generated.
</pre>

#### If your really want to remove this warning then simply navigate to the main funciton and replace "void" with "int" and also set "return 0" at the end of the main function.

### Happy C coding/!! ðŸ™ƒ
